console.log("Hello, world!");


// Question 1: Use console.log to output your full name to the console.
console.log("Godsent Salvaloza");

// Question 2: Output your year of birth.
console.log("2024");

// Question 3: Try again to output your year of birth, this time passing the date without the quotes.
console.log(2024);

// Question 4: We can pass several arguments to console.log separated by commas, e.g.:
console.log("Godsent", "Salvaloza", "(2024)")

// Question 5: Output the same information (name, surname, year) to the console, not side by side, but on consecutive lines.
console.log("Godsent");
console.log("Salvaloza");
console.log("(2024)");

// Question 6: A string can be concatenated using the + sign, for example "abc" + "def" will be treated as "abcdef". Try writing your name, surname, and year of birth on one line again, this time not separated by commas, but by + signs.
console.log("Godsent" + "Salvaloza" + "(2024)");

// Question 7: Put spaces in the appropriate places, so that when displayed, you get the same effect as in Question 4.
console.log("Godsent" + " Salvaloza " + "(2024)");
